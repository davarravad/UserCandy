# UserCandy Framework

UserCandy is a simple PHP/MySQL website framework. It provides a basic login system, routing, and default pages that can be customized without modifying the core.

## Requirements
- PHP 7.4+
- MySQL

## Installation
1. Copy `app/default-config.php` to `app/config.php` and update your database credentials and OAuth settings.
2. Create a MySQL database and run the following to create the roles and users tables:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE roles (
     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     is_default TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
   );

   INSERT INTO roles (name, is_default) VALUES
     ('guest',1),('member',1),('admin',1),('staff',0);

   CREATE TABLE users (
     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member',
     avatar VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL
   );
   ```
3. Serve the `public` directory as your web root so requests are handled by `public/index.php`.

### Web server configuration
For Apache you can set the `DocumentRoot` to the `public` folder:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot /path/to/UserCandy/public
    <Directory /path/to/UserCandy/public>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

The same idea works with other web servers (nginx, etc.) – just point the server root to `public` so all requests go through `public/index.php`.

If `app/config.php` is missing, the framework will display a setup message instead of crashing.

## Customization
Add or modify pages in the `app/pages` directory. Files in this folder override files in `pages` with the same name, allowing upgrades without overwriting custom code.
The templates in the `templates` directory load a header and footer using Tailwind CSS for styling.
The footer text and other common labels come from the language files so they can be translated easily.
You can create additional template folders (e.g. `templates/simple`) and set the active template in `app/config.php` using the `template` option. Individual pages may also override the template by setting `$meta['template']` before calling `render_header()`. 
On first run the `home.php`, `about.php` and `contact.php` pages are automatically copied into `app/pages` so you can edit them without touching the core folder.

## OAuth Login
Enable Google, Discord, Windows, or Facebook login by setting the appropriate flags and credentials in `app/config.php`.
You may also enable Google reCAPTCHA on the login and registration forms by
setting `enable_recaptcha` to `true` and providing your site and secret keys.

## Default Pages
- `/` – Home
- `/login` – Login page
- `/register` – Registration page
- `/dashboard` – Protected user dashboard
- `/profile/{id}` – Public user profile by ID

## Interface Features
- **Navigation bar** with sample links, user menu and notification bell.
- **Popup notifications** using `showPopup(message, type)` where `type` is `success` or `error`.
- **Light/Dark theme toggle** via the sun/moon button in the nav bar.
- **Notification system**. Use `add_notification($title, $url)` in PHP to queue a notice for the current user. When the user follows the generated link the notice is automatically marked as read.
- **Language files** in `languages/` allow easy translation of common text. Set the default language in `config.php`.
- **Footer text** is also loaded from the language files.

### Using the notification helper
In any PHP page after `core/init.php` has been included, call:

```php
add_notification('Check this page', base_url('some/page'));
```

The notification will appear in the bell menu for the current user. Links generated by `add_notification` automatically append a `notify` parameter so that visiting the page marks it as read.

## Roles and Access Control
Roles are defined in the `roles` table. The built in `guest`, `member` and `admin`
roles cannot be changed but additional roles can be added from the admin panel.
Each user stores the role name in the `role` column. To protect a page you can call
`require_role($role)` after including `core/auth.php`:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../core/auth.php';
require_role('staff');
```

Pass a single role or an array of allowed roles. Unauthorised visitors will be
redirected or see a 403 error.

## AJAX User Table
An example dynamic table is available at `/users`. It loads data with jQuery and allows inline editing by double-clicking cells. Edits are saved automatically.
